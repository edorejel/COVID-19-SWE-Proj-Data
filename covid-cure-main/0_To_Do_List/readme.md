# To-Do List

I made a to-do list that I never check. Never make list! I'll remember this time!


- Finish the social module of the COVID-19 pdf https://github.com/covid-cure/COVID-19/blob/master/original_brainstorming_notes/wild_topics/B/behavior/readme.md
- Add COVID-19's main behavior to the COVID-19 pdf
- Add Some Stuff on Flies: fly research https://github.com/xpqx/disclaimerReadFirst/tree/master/PhD_wild_topics/I/insects/F/flies#flies

- Add stuff on determining whether COVID-19 came from a lab (right now, I think it did just based on the circumstances and China's behavior at the beginning and throughout the entire pandemic).
- However, there are issues with this:
- - Did China trick the scientists into working on COVID-19 not knowing what it was really for?
- - Did China plan on Joe Biden winning the election so that they can have easy, legal, and legitimate access to the Whitehouse to influence foreign and domestic policy?
- - If Joe Biden wins, China will not be held responsible and he'll more than likely move away from holding them responsible. I think China might be betting on this scenario.
- - Right now, it looks like Joe Biden has very deep ties with China as in he is their unofficial representative. Labelling President Trump a Russian agent appear to have been done to divert attention from Joe Biden's situation.
- - From the stuff that coming out about Joe Biden, there is a concerning pattern with the Coronavirus, and it looks like China maybe did go all in on a Joe Biden win. If he wins, China will not be held responsible and he would use his influence as U.S. President to influence other nations to not hold China responsible. This scenario could happen.
