# COVID-19 Psychological Warfare Operation 

## (So many questions, so much behavior to analyze, right?)

I changed the name because there is now enough publicly available evidence to call an aspect of a COVID-19 a psychological warfare operation aimed at damaging President Trump's image using racism as the main tool.

Don't believe me? Here, read this: Exclusive: 600 U.S. Groups Linked to Chinese Communist Party Influence Effort with Ambition Beyond Election https://www.newsweek.com/2020/11/13/exclusive-600-us-groups-linked-chinese-communist-party-influence-effort-ambition-beyond-1541624.html

## Keyphrase: This Scenario Now Exist

It is starting to look like the pandemic has an operational element within it involving psychological warfare and propaganda aimed at damaging President Trump's image in the media and the public. The final result, as Joe Biden perfectly did, was to actually describe President Trump as a racist during the debates. Joe Biden did this part right, he called President Trump a racist durign the debates. It does not mean Joe Biden is correct, but he does not have to be correct because he knows the media won't question him about his accusations towards Trump. Joe Biden called Trump a racist multiple times because that was required for the operation. China started the operation to label President Trump a racist. The democrats, the mainstream media, Joe Biden, and others went a long with it very well. At the third debate, Joe Biden was supposed to finish or maybe continue the the operation by calling President Trump a racist with the entire country watching.

__Terminology in Question__
- - 1st phrase: "okay boomer" <--- What is the exact origin of this phrase and how did it spread?
- - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_boomer
- - Why didn't the social justice warriors and various other activist take issue with the phrase as it involves ageism?
- - 2nd phrase: "boomer remover" <--- What is the exact origin of this phrase and how did it spread?
- - __(Article from 3.19.2020)__ Morbid ‘boomer remover’ coronavirus meme only makes millennials seem more awful https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/morbid-boomer-remover-coronavirus-meme-only-makes-millennials-seem-more-awful/
- - Why didn't the social justice warriors and various other activist take issue with the phrase as it involves ageism?
- - Social justice warriors took issue with racism, classism, nazim(if you could believe this one),  sexism, any-other-ism, but not ageism. Why?
- - I'm sure there are explanations as to why ageism was not made a big issue.


- __This scenario is developing!__ 
- It is starting to feel like there was some type of operational element or coordinated effort to damage President Trump's image.
- The underlying pattern within the data is that President Trump was supposed to be portrayed as a racist.
- - It starts with the racist seed that China planted in the public by calling President Trump racist in regards to his handling of the pandemic.
- - Democrats fought to control language and labeled anything that did not align to their accepted language for describing COVID-19 as racist.
- - Couple the racist perception with fear, and mask wearing.
- - So you have, fear, mask, and racist.
- - Then, throw in noose, White supremacy, and White Supremist. What image does this conjure up? Perhaps on a subliminal level?
- - Throw in the people that died by hanging during the pandemic (*I assume these were all verified as factually happening and not suicide or fake reports*).
- - Throw in the sports organization with their stunts.
- - Then, throw in massive censoring by various media outlets to include social media. What does the massive censoring conjure up? Perhaps on a subliminal level?
- - This would explain why the FBI pursued the racecar driver noose story so strongly. It's about symbolism and projection.
- - Doesn't the FBI have a racist history? (*I need to verify this part. History and FBI matters are not usually my thing.*)
- - FBI Director Christopher Wray will be removed from post if Trump is re-elected, source tells Fox News https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-director-christopher-wray-will-be-removed-reelection (*There might be an issue with Wray. He probably does need firing.*)

This strategy was a culmination of months of shaping public perception to damage President Trump's image in the polls, throw him off his game by labelling him a racist. However, the debates were all geared to help Joe Biden and even then, Joe Biden couldn't seal the deal and sell the racist image of President Trump.*)


- James Clapper said last year that what the Obama Administration did to the Trump campaign "meets the dictionary definition of SPYING" https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1320583872292290561
- - I have my concerns about this spying issue, but now, the spying and everything related to the Russia Hoax and the impeachment looks like it was to keep Trump guessing, to throw him off his game, to keep him off balance, so when something like COVID-19 hits, he is caught off guard. Slip in the subtle psychological operation to change Trump's perception in the public to that of a racist, and no one would notice what is happening.
- - Joe Biden was allowed to call President Trump a racist, in public, on video, and no one in the media questioned it because that was the Op - portray Trump as a racist. Joe's operatives took care of the rest.
- - Clapper seems alright. So what dictionary is used to define spying between political rivals? Is it a legal dictionary or a regular everyday usage dictionary?
- - If Barr found nothing wrong with whatever he was investigating related to the Russian Hoax, then the Russian Hoax was a psyop designed to keep Trump off balance and to create mistrust between Trump and the public.
- - The final (maybe it's the last one) psyop to try to damange Trump's image in the public was to portray Trump as a racist without question. What's the symbolism when a candidate for U.S. President can call the current U.S. President a racist and no one questions it?
- - It looks like creating distrust in the medical professionals was also part of the plan. Why else would you censor medical doctors?
- - Ultimately, this entire thing is starting to look like it was just to create a lot of mistrust in the American people. I think concept being used is the fear of the unknown coupled with racism. COVID-19 is real, but the way the media handled it, attacking medical professionals, censoring them, restricting their ability to give their informed opinions, it appears to be part of the concept of increasing fear and distrust. Then, voters go to the voting booths with these concepts in their minds, throw in President Trump being called a racist on TV, and it could spell doom for his re-election chances.

#### ************** currently working on this part ************

#### ******** old update ***************************


- Anything that would damage President Trump's image, could be beneficial to Joe Biden's chances of getting elected. There is a very small and subtle pattern to examine. It could explain why Trump might have lost his position in some polls. It is looking like the pandemic has certain elements that could be viewed as coordinated and part of a propaganda operation to damage President Trump's image with the goal of making him appear weak in relation to Joe Biden.
- Joe Biden has been getting a free ride through the majority of the election season.
- Joe Biden had debates catered to him by only focusing on topics where he could appear strong.
- Italy might have been a distraction.
- The hug-a-Chinese person campaign might have been on purpose to increase the spread of COVID-19.
- This might sound like much, but when you are certain that you can rig an election for U.S. President, then any risks are worth it. China felt certain they could help Joe Biden win.
- This aspects of COVID-19 require more analysis.


- __Need to add or research the following items:__
- Why social media companies fought hard and continue to fight against medical doctors appearing hopeful in the fight against COVID-19.
- - The issue here could be that President Trump has appeared with these doctors, so in the media, this would create an image of President Trump appearing with medical doctors that are oferring hope in the fight against COVID-19. This move could be bad for Joe Biden.
- Why the mainstream media fought so hard against medical doctors to downplay the benefits of HCQ and the other stuff?
- Why some governors also fought very hard against allowing medical doctors to prescribe HCQ?
- - possible explanation: it was in the mainstream media's best interests to increase fear in the public
- - altenative scenario explanation: the mainstream media was in on the operation (possible foreign operation) to help Joe Biden get elected
- - (*This would help to add doubt to President Trump's abilities to lead a country through a crisis, potentially associating fear and uncertainty with President Trump.*)
- - (*During the initial stages of the pandemic, I kept on reading somewhere that Biden and Obama did not leave something fully stocked for pandemics. Is this a bad move to sabotage Trump? I'm not too sure yet.*)
- - (*Could Obama and Biden do something like this on purpose to sabotage the incoming administration knowing that Biden would be running for president? Pandemics are supposed to be untraceable for the most part, or no one would analyze the behavior of a pandemic, right?*)
- - (*The scenario exist that the "Russian Collusion Hoax" was a distraction for something. Could it have been a distraction to be unprepared for a pandemic?*)
- - (*It was also displayed somewhere in online media that President Trump dismantled certain parts of a pandemic response policy or thing related to pandemic responses. This move here by President Trump does not necessarily equate to a bad decision.*)
- - (*Now, anything related to a country's prepardness for a pandemic seems like it should be kept quiet because knowing that a country's ability to respond to a pandemic is bad, for example, could be exploited. If China knew, I'm sure it crossed their minds to exploit it in some way.*)

- - __Questions developing from scenario recently unlocked:__
- Just how much help, and from who did Joe Biden receive to get elected, and how did they help him?
- Why some social media companies also came out very strongly against medical doctors prescribing HCQ?
- Why try to push an unjustified sense of despair on the population during this pandemic?
- If there was no COVID-19, what would Joe Biden be running on?

- __Joe Biden Out of Nowhere Tweet About Pandemics on 10.24.2019__
- None of these 195 countries — the U.S. included — is fully prepared for a pandemic, report says https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/none-these-countries-us-included-is-fully-prepared-pandemic-report-says/
- https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1187386520837246976 
- It is only a pandemic because China let it happen. There is no other excuse. So in that regard, China showed bad leadership.
- Did Trump tweet about a pandemic at around the same timeframe? If he didn't, then there might be an issue or pattern here worth investigating.
- Was the Trump Administration, including the intel agencies, tweeting or concerned about pandemics at the same time or around the same time that Joe Biden made that tweet?
- If not, there might be an issue or pattern worth investigating.



#### ************** currently working on this part ************

Adding to the COVID-19 political analysis, hostile foreign actors are trying to help Joe Biden win because a Joe Biden win would be beneficial to them. 
- BREAKING: FBI confirms Iran is sending fake emails posing as 'Proud Boys' to help Joe Biden https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1319060838494470149
- Joe Biden even tried to direct attention to President Trump during some interview where Joe Biden says something to the effect of, "Focus on this man" or something close to that.
- - Joe Biden says "Focus on this man." Joe Biden says Focus on This Man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ma5wFXhhfc
- During the first debate, Joe Biden tried to purposely single out President Trump, to sell the idea that President Trump was some sort of figure to hate.
- - Joe Biden even resorted to calling President Trump a clown during the first debate. Joe Biden calls Donald Trump a 'clown' during argument about Hunter Biden https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4NOXT-ekbo
- - Biden calls Trump a "CLOWN" during first presidential debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV-7KtvBNLI
- I think Joe Biden was doing this to try to tap into the racism seed that China planted, and some in the mainstream media echoed without question. 
- I'm a little busy with some stuff, but there is more evidence publicly available floating around the Internet that China may have a vested interest in Joe Biden winning.
- It is starting to look like COVID-19 does have many layers to it, with the end result of China (possibly other nations hostile to America and Americans), dictating foreign and domestic policy using legal means. This would be really bad, and would be the end of America.


- __(Video Link from 9.23.2020)__ Joe Biden says Focus on This Man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ma5wFXhhfc 
- - Joe Biden on video somewhere said about President Trump, "Focus on this man."
- - (*Joe Biden might have been acting in this video footage to try to invoke some type of negative emotion directed at President Trump. Again, the symbolism of Joe Biden telling you to focus on President Trump, but being said in an outraged and angry manner. This might have been part of the strategy that Joe Biden was using to try to shape public image of President Trump in a negative light.*)

- Joe Biden did not seal the deal at the debate, whatever deal he had to seal to come out victorious. 
- Joe Biden was not allowed to sell his business deals with China as a positive factor.
- Joe Biden would also keep on bringing up that one hoax about North Carolina, "the fine people hoax". Joe Biden would do this almost out context, but it didn't matter as long as it was caught on camera and allowed to be broadcast.
- Some if not all in the mainstream media would not stop harassing President Trump about disavowing White Supremacy.
- I believe Wray was also on media somewhere complaining about White Supremacy.
- This scenario is evolving, but HB's laptop appears to tie everything together nicely.

- - *I still don't fully undersand this move other than it being a symbolic gesture part of the potential operation to portray President Trump as a racist or try to blame him for many racial issues. This symbolic gesture conveys various things, but it shows the name Trump, it is his building, so one of the messages conveyed is, "Yeah, we're here in front of your building." There could be other meanings conveyed. Why didn't de Blasio paint, "COVID-19 Lives Matter" or "Your COVID-19 Response Sucks" or "China Sucks"? Why the message switch? This act by de Blasio did not accomplish anything, but propaganda against President Trump.*

#### Hostile Actors are Desperate

- They want Joe Biden to win so bad. Joe Biden is possibly compromised and susceptible to blackmail to then influence American domestic and foreign policy to benefit America's enemies. Hostile actors know they have a good opportunity to change the face of America permanently, if Joe Biden is elected. This is bad.
