# COVID-19: A Hypothetical Software Engineering Behavioral Analysis on COVID-19 to Find a Viable Cure

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status: 

- ONGOING AND IN PROGRESS
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Reason for Status: 

- COVID-19 is a very large body of academic work and research. COVID-19 appears to cover many academic disciplines. I think this is understandable given that it has so many layers. 

- What is a layer? A layer is an area that COVID-19 has affected in some way and this area could be useful for analysis.
- A political layer means that COVID-19 has affected political life.
- A geopolitical layer means that COVID-19 has affected geopolitical relations.
- A cultural layer means that COVID-19 has affected cultural relations.
- A psychological layer means that COVID-19 has a psychological component that is worthy of analysis.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Reason for this study:

- I am trying to understand how COVID-19 is identifying hosts to enter based on its behavioral tendencies. A behavioral tendency is just a different way of saying pattern of behavior. A different way of viewing this is: How is COVID-19 seeing the world to only infect particular people in the population?
- __A different and easier way of understanding this is: Why is COVID-19 gravitating to certain people and not others?__

### Some Information on Reverse-Engineering

- I added some information on reverse-engineering to maybe help you understand how I am analyzing COVID-19.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### This study does the following:

- This hypothetical study on COVID-19 examines the behavior of COVID-19. The behavior of COVID-19 is taken from publicly available sources. 

### How this study proceeds:

The behavior of COVID-19 is going to be analyzed in three stages:

*1. As COVID-19 moves in search of a viable host.*
* - COVID-19's mechanism to search for a viable host has possibly been identified. I call that mechanism The Sun Test.
* - COVID-19: The Sun Test https://github.com/covid-cure/COVID-19/blob/master/COVID-19_The_Sun_Test/readme.md#covid-19-the-sun-test
* - COVID-19's mechanism for detecting and infecting non-traditional hosts, that is, young people that appear healthy, has possibly been identified.
* - - This mechanism is starting to take shape. This mechanism could account for COVID-19 infecting young people. For now, this mechanism appears to be some type of parental instinct that COVID-19 may have. However, the parental instinct in COVID-19 is still trying to protect its flight ability.
* - - COVID-19 appears to be using pheromones or some other type of signal that humans, as mammals, may be emitting at the molecular level, but this signal is not immediately
visible to humans.
* - - COVID-19 could use signals from other pheromones emitted by various elements in the human body that would also match elements found in a bat's body, however, to immediately get out of the Sun, because the Sun is detrimental to it and bat survival, COVID-19 would "smell" for Vitamin D levels.

*2. After COVID-19 enters a host.*

*3. Before COVID-19 causes an infection in the host.*


### COVID-19's Main Behavioral Pattern


- I think COVID-19's behavioral pattern at the molecular level has been identified. I think this is its main thought process.
- That behavior pattern is as follows:
- - Do I detect a large amount of something?
- - Do I need this large amount of something for survival?
- - Do I detect a small amount of something?
- - Do I need this small amount of something for survival?
- - Depending on the answers to the questions above is how COVID-19 appears to regulate its behavior to determine who to designate as a viable host.
- - Now that I think about it, I think the four questions could be the essence of life.

*This is great!*

### PDF Versions

The PDF version will always be more up-to-date than the images of the presentation because it is easier to upload a single PDF file instead of uploading several images, and then formatting these same images for easy viewing.

__DISCLAIMER:__ 

- Repo dedicated to COVID-19 (Coronavirus) research and cure. COVID-19 has many layers to it, so other minor stuff related to COVID-19 is included.
- Everything about a viable cure to COVID-19 is in the hypothetical stages and treated as a piece of software.
- I will try to keep this one as professional, and presentable as possible.
- The PDF presentation shows general hypothetical behavioral tendencies of COVID-19 before the human body responds negatively to its presence in the human body. 
- The information in this hypothetical study is not medical advice.
